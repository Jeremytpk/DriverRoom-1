DriverRoom Privacy Policy
Effective Date: March 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how DriverRoom, created by Jeremy Topaka, collects, uses, and shares information from users of our mobile application ("DriverRoom," "the App," "the Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

1. Information We Collect

We collect information to provide, maintain, and improve our services. The types of information we collect include:

Information You Provide Directly:

User Account Information: When a driver or company creates an account, we collect personal information such as name, email address, phone number, and a profile photo.

Authentication Data: We collect username and password to secure your account.

Gate Codes and Notes: Drivers and companies may voluntarily submit gate codes, access instructions, and specific notes about gated communities. This information is a core part of the Service.

Chat and Communication Data: We collect the content of messages sent through the App's group chats and one-on-one chats.

User-Generated Content: If a company allows drivers to create or see posts, we collect the content of those posts.

Information We Collect Automatically:

Usage Data: We collect information on how you use the App, such as the features you access, the gate codes you search for, and the time you spend on the App.

Device Information: We collect information about the device you use to access DriverRoom, including the device model, operating system, and unique device identifiers.

Location Information: We may collect general location data to verify that a driver is on an assigned route and to assist in rescue assignments.

2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

To Provide and Manage the Service: To operate DriverRoom, to create and manage user accounts, and to deliver the core functionality of gate code sharing.

To Enhance Security and Safety:

We use driver status information ("on-duty" or "off-duty") to control access to the driver dashboard and gate code database, ensuring that only drivers on an active route have access.

We use the submitted gate codes to provide a secure and efficient resource for authorized drivers.

We use communication data to facilitate internal company communication and support.

To Improve Our Services: We analyze usage data to understand how the App is being used, identify areas for improvement, and develop new features.

For Communication: We use your contact information to send you updates, announcements, and safety tips as posted by your company.

To Enforce Policies: We use your information to enforce our policies and terms of service. For example, we use account information to prevent companies from deleting driver profiles without a request to DriverRoom.

3. Sharing and Disclosure of Information

We do not sell your personal information. We only share information in the following circumstances:

With Your Company: The company you work for has full access to the information you provide and generate on the platform, including your on-duty status, rescue assignments, and communication data. They do not have access to the encrypted gate codes.

With Other Drivers: Within the App, other drivers from your company may be able to see your name, profile picture, and chat messages depending on your company's communication settings.

For Legal and Safety Reasons: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect the personal safety of users or the public, or protect against legal liability.

Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your information may be transferred to the acquiring entity.

4. Data Security

We are committed to protecting your data. We use commercially acceptable methods to protect your information, including encryption for sensitive data like gate codes. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

5. Your Rights and Choices

Account Access: Drivers and companies can manage and update their account information (e.g., profile photo, email, password) directly within the App.

Data Deletion: To delete a driver account, a company must submit a request to DriverRoom with the necessary documentation. This process is in place to ensure the integrity of the data and prevent unauthorized deletions.

6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new policy within the App or on our website. We will also update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.
